| User story | Task | Member Responsible for the Task | Task Assigned to | Estimated Effort per Task | Priority(A-E) | Reason |
| :--------- | :--- | :------------------------------ | :--------------- | :------------------------ | :------------ | :---- |
| As a developer we want to have a clear user interface so that the therapist can easily use the software | Make a design interaction plan | Carlos | Carlos/Wim/Leon | 8 | A | Having a good user interface is a very important fact when developing a application for users. |
| As a developer we want to see how to use the repositories | Job to run unit tests and collect results | Boris | Boris | 3 | A | CI is very important for developing. Automating running tests is also very important. |
| As a developer I want to have feedback from the professor and CleVR | Make a demo  | Carlos | Carlos | 4 | A | High priority because the communication with the stakeholders is an important factor in the development process |
|  | Add in demo what are goals for next week are and what went wrong this week | Carlos | Carlos | 1 | B | |
|  | Send the demo for feedback to CleVR | Carlos | Carlos | 1 | C | |
| As a developer we want to exchange information between the client and the server by connecting the GUI with Unity | Send dynamic objects from Unity | Boris | Boris/Adriaan | 14 | A | Import because the client can not display stuff if he doesn't receive the data from Unity. |
|  | Test the Unity plugin | Adriaan | Adriaan/Boris | 8 | B | |
|  | Test whether we can break the synchronization of the implementation the protocol | Carlos | Carlos/Wim | 6 | C | |
|  | Display error when connection fails | Wim | Wim/Adriaan | 5 | C | |
| As a therapist I want to be able to see the patients location in the virtual world | Display the patient location | Leon | Leon/Adriaan | 10 | A | This week our main priority is to finish the static map and show the patient's location. That's why This has A priority. |
|  | Design a natural, clear way to display walk- and FoV rotation of the patient | Carlos | Carlos | 4 | B | |
|  | Display the patient walking orientation | Carlos | Carlos | 4 | C | |
| As a developer we want to avoid crashes by having a properly tested software product | Test dotCover en look whether it is usefull for our project | Wim | Wim | 3 | A
|  | Achieve 80% code coverage by writing missing tests | Wim | Wim | 6 | B | Good testing is important! |
|  | Report results back to Github PR | Adriaan | Adriaan | 2 | C | |
| As a therapist we want to see a static map of a 3D environment | Display TV | Leon | Leon | 3 | B | Final part from the static map user story needs to be finished quick. |
| As a student we need to update our Architecture Design | Update Design Goals | Carlos | Carlos | 2 | B | B-priority because it is important that we keep track of our design because it will make developing more clear for the developers and the TA |
|  | Update Subsystem Decomposition/Hardware, software mapping | Carlos | Carlos | 2 | B | |
|  | Update Persistent data management, concurrency | Carlos | Carlos | 2 | B | |
| As a therapist I want to be able to see the moving objects in the virtual world | Update Actors to current positions | Wim | Wim/Leon | 16 | B | B-priority because this is also part of the main requirements to have a dynamic map |
|  | Display Actors in the virtual world | Wim | Wim | 5 | B | |
|  | Interface to calculate differences between actor locations | Adriaan | Adriaan/Wim | 5 | E | |
| As a therapist I want to be able to see the patients field of view in the virtual world | Send the FoV to GUI client | Boris | Boris | 2 | C | Hard to implement but not a very imporant requirement |
|  | Display the FoV | Carlos | Carlos | 2 | C | |
| As a therapist I want to be able to see the state of objects in the virtual world | Display the tv screen text | Leon | Leon | 2 | D | Important requirement for the dynamic map. This is not needed to be finished this sprint. |
|  | Display if the car siren is on/off | Carlos | Carlos | 2 | D | |
