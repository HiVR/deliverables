Problems:
We again had cases of sickness this week.

Solution: There is still no clear-cut solution for this, except hoping they will be better next week. The rest of the group just worked on their own code.

For the next sprint:
Focus more on the bare essentials, instead off on the less necessary functions. We got a priority update from CleVR, which we will use in the coming sprint.
