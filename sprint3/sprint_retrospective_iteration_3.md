## Main Problems Encountered
### Product Planning Final
#### Description: Product Planning was not in the sprint planning but needed to be done
Reaction: Carlos/Boris/Leon picked it up but had less time for the other tasks. For the next sprints we need to make sure we plan everything in the sprint planning.
### Effort times badly guessed
#### Description: Most tasks took way more hours than we had estimated
Reaction: Some tasks have not been done because we didn have enough time left in the week. We need to make better time estimates for the next sprint.
### Uncertainties of WPF
#### Description: Many different ways to use WPF, but not enough relevant documentation
Reaction: Long searching, random blog posts.

## Adjustments for the next Sprint
We need to to make better hour effort estimates because we now have a better vision on how long things may take.  
We need to make sure that everything is in the sprint planning and there are no unforeseen tasks.
