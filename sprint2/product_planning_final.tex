\section{Introduction}
In this document, the following will be discussed: first, a MoSCoW model to determine which features are needed. Second, a product backlog with global user stories based on the features that are needed. Third, a release plan according to what should be finished following the road map. Last, a description of when a feature is done, when a sprint is done and when a release is done.

\section{Product Backlog}
	\subsection{User stories of features}
    
    \begin{itemize}
		\item As a therapist I want to see a clear visual overview of the virtual world
        \item As a therapist I want to be able to see the objects in the virtual world
        \item As a therapist I want to be able to see the moving objects in the virtual world
        \item As a therapist I want to be able to see trajectories of moving objects in the virtual world
        \item As a therapist I want to be able to see the patients location in the virtual world
        \item As a therapist I want to be able to see the patients field of view in the virtual world
        \item As a therapist I want to be able to see the state of objects in the virtual world
        \item As a therapist I want to be able to manipulate the state of objects in the virtual world
        \item As a therapist I want to be able to see which objects can be manipulated
        \item As a therapist I want to be able to touch objects to manipulate them
        \item As a therapist I want to change what the patient can see on the television
        \item As a therapist I want to play sounds in the virtual world
        \item As a therapist I want to play sounds from a specified location in the virtual world
