## Main Problems Encountered
### Not many workdays in sprint
#### Description: Due to vacation on thursday and friday we had less work hours to spend
Reaction: More work per day, some task not done
### The review/finalize effort was underestimated
#### Description: The draft versions from product planning/review were not as good as expected
Reaction: We needed to spend a lot more time finalizing the reports

## Adjustments for the next Sprint
More coding!  
More physical meetings.  
More communication, Since we were relatively unresponsive to each other via IM last week.
